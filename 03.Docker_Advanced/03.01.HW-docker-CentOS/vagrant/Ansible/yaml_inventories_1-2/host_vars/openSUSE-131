# Host level user definition (username property/key).
username: user_host_openSUSE-131
#
# # # CONCLUSION :
# IN ODER WORDS:
  # this will be refered when the particular host is addressed, however
  # if the group this host belong to is adressed then the group level
  # property/key with of that same string.ref will be used. Ex:
    # username:user_group(or what ever value)
# The rule is 1st found used, but if NOT FOUND **use what it is found** and
# buble-up to the owning/paren-group to look for what WAS NOT FOUND at this
# addressed-level-of-the-inventory
